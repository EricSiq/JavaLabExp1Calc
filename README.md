This is a basic Java-based calculator that can perform simple mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and more! It also includes functions for calculating Fibonacci sequences, mean, and variance of an array.  

Features  
- Add, Subtract, Multiply, and Divide two numbers  
- Generate Fibonacci sequence  
- Compute Mean and Variance of an array  
- User-friendly menu-based interface  

Java Files used:  
- `UserInput.java` – Handles user input for numbers and arrays  
- `Calculator.java` – Performs all mathematical operations  
- `Main.java` – Contains the main program and menu  

Example Output:
Select an operation:  
1. Addition  
2. Subtraction  
3. Multiplication  
4. Division  
5. Fibonacci Sequence  
6. Mean of Array  
7. Variance of Array  
8. Exit  
Enter your choice: 1  
Enter the first number: 10  
Enter the second number: 5  
Sum: 15  

Note:
- The program will ask for numbers once and reuse them for calculations.  
- Division by zero is handeled safely with a warning.  
- The Fibonacci sequence function prints the first `n` terms.
